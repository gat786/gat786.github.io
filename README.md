Hey there this is my personal website..

I am a programming enthusiast I am currently working on mobile development frameworks but I wish to work on machine  learning and other artificial intelligence related subjects too.

Here is a list of applications that I have built so far..

1) Quiz App

This app was made as a college project in Flutter using dart language and was my first ever cross platform application ever. And i should also inform you that I just love dart.

Thanks for visiting
